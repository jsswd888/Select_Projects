2. To better understand the knowledges that I've learned in the University.
3. **Note that:** in `course_description` folder, I have categorize course descriptions into two folders. You may find most courses related to topics in finance & statistics under `UChicago` folder, and mostly computer science course under `UW-Madison` folder.
