# Select_Projects

This repository displays some of the selected project's demos, and also included some description writeups regarding to a couple Computer Science courses that I've taken so far. The aim of creating this repository is to help employers better understand:

1. Some projects that I have worked on, in detail, which may or may not on my resume.
2. To better understand the knowledges that I've learned in the University.

Some of the course descriptions may also helpful for fellow UW-Madison students who is intending to take certain courses to understand what will be taught on each of these courses, in more detail.
