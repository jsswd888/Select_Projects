## General Introduction ##
The course's name is *Code and Power*. It covers some simple skills related to `HTML` and `PHP`. The Course Introduction from School Enrollment Website is given below:

*As students confront assumptions about gender race and computing, this course will also equip them with the skills necessary to confidently design, develop, and discuss web scripting aspects related to HTML/CSS/PHP website development.*

## Selected Project
The selected project for this course is the final project, which is a combination of all past projects done in this course: It is a website that is for an upcoming one-time community technology-training or technology-building event online. (Each team may choose its event’s theme and goals; if you would like to work on a real-world event, that’s absolutely fine.)

This website is consists of multiple pages, including:
- a home page explaining and advertising the event
- detailed schedule (you may invent this)
- event rules/policies, and any other information you believe attendees need to feel safe and included (we’ll definitely talk in class about what this might be)
- a PHP-based registration form (n.b. information from the form can be emailed or stored as a flat file; it may also go in
- a database if a group member has the requisite MySQL knowledge, but this is NOT REQUIRED)
- a PHP-based “contact us” form (same as above)
