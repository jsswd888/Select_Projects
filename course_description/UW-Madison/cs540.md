## General Introduction
CS 540 talks about general topics in Artificial Intelligence. It has go through varities topics under the big umbrella of "Artificial Intelligence":

- Machine Learning (ML)
- Deep Learning (DL)
- Reinforcement Learning - (RL) HW10
- Natural Langauge Processing - (NLP)
- Neural Networks (NN) HW06/07
- A star Search Problems HW08
- Game Theory

From School's Enrollment Website, the CS 540's introduction is given below:

*Principles of knowledge-based search techniques, automatic deduction, knowledge representation using predicate logic, machine learning, probabilistic reasoning. Applications in tasks such as problem solving, data mining, game playing, natural language understanding, computer vision, speech recognition, and robotics.*

Some of the projects implemented during taking this course is published here. Below is the general info introduction (what topics related) about projects not mentioned above:
- HW02: Classification, prediction in uncertain situations
- HW03: Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
- HW05: Linear Regression
