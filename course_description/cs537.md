## General Introduction
CS 537 is one of the **best and hardest** Computer Science course at University of Wisconsin - Madison. All selected projects takes 24+ hours to finish. It includes all general contents related to Operating System. The instructor of the course is professor [Remzi Arpaci-dussaeu](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/).

The textbook used in this course is: [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)

The course website can be found [here](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Fall2022/). It's a good reference of what is discussed on the course.

From School's Enrollment Website, the CS 537's introduction is given below:

*Input-output hardware, interrupt handling, properties of magnetic tapes, discs and drums, associative memories and virtual address translation techniques. Batch processing, time sharing and real-time systems, scheduling resource allocation, modular software systems, performance measurement and system evaluation.*

## Course Projects:

This course is open-source, and hence most project description can be found on the course website [here](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Fall2022/).

**`./p2a`**: An implementation of **Unix Shell `./wish`**. Basic Description of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects/tree/master/processes-shell). Note that **Parallel Commands** section is not finished, but instead finishing **`if statement`** handling (see details [here](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects/tree/master/processes-shell)).

**`./p2b`**: A re-implementation of xv6 **scheduling policy** (priority-based scheduler with **high/low** priority only) & adding of **virtual memory** management section. The basic project descriptions can be found [here](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Fall2022/Projects/p2b.html),[here for scheduling](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects/tree/master/scheduling-xv6-lottery), and [here for virtual memory management](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects/tree/master/scheduling-xv6-lottery).
